# Protobuf + ZeroMQ Applications

This repository contains an application to enable communication in between the Fast DDS driven [RAPTOR applications](https://github.com/raptor-ethz/reference_generator) and the ZeroMQ + Protobuf driven vision system [here](https://github.com/srl-ethz/detectron-realsense).

All Protobuf files are automatically compiled and included via CMake thanks to [this repository](https://github.com/leimao/Protocol-Buffer-Examples) and the examples it provides.
